# AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Presentation

## Introduction to AWS ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. ECS eliminates the need to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure.

### Key Components of ECS

1. **Clusters**
   - A logical grouping of EC2 instances or Fargate resources
   - Serves as the foundation for running tasks and services

2. **Task Definitions**
   - JSON files that describe one or more containers that form your application
   - Define parameters like CPU, memory, ports, volumes, environment variables, etc.
   - Similar to a Dockerfile combined with runtime configuration

3. **Tasks**
   - Instances of a task definition that are running
   - Can be run individually or as part of a service

4. **Services**
   - Maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition
   - Provide auto-recovery for failed tasks
   - Can be integrated with load balancers for distribution of traffic

5. **Container Instances**
   - EC2 instances running the ECS container agent
   - Register into your clusters and run container tasks

6. **Launch Types**
   - **EC2 Launch Type**: You manage the EC2 instances in your cluster
   - **Fargate Launch Type**: Serverless option where AWS manages the infrastructure

## Benefits of Using ECS

- **Simplified Management**: No need to manage the container orchestration infrastructure
- **AWS Integration**: Native integration with other AWS services like IAM, CloudWatch, ALB, etc.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale your applications up or down
- **Security**: Fine-grained security controls through IAM roles
- **Cost-Effective**: Only pay for the resources you use, with options to optimize costs
- **Flexibility**: Choose between EC2 and Fargate launch types based on your needs

## ECS vs. Other Container Orchestration Services

| Feature | ECS | Kubernetes | Docker Swarm |
|---------|-----|------------|--------------|
| Management | AWS Managed | Self-managed (or EKS) | Self-managed |
| Learning Curve | Low | High | Medium |
| AWS Integration | Native | Through plugins | Limited |
| Ecosystem | AWS Services | Large open-source | Docker focused |
| Deployment | Simple | Complex | Moderate |

## Free Tier Details

AWS Free Tier for ECS includes:

- **EC2 Launch Type**: 750 hours per month of t2.micro EC2 instances (for 12 months)
- **Fargate Launch Type**: Not included in the free tier
- **Load Balancer**: 750 hours per month (for 12 months)
- **ECR**: 500MB of storage for 12 months

## Deployment Architecture

Our demo application uses the following architecture:

1. **Application Layer**:
   - Node.js Express API containerized with Docker
   - Deployed as ECS Service with multiple tasks

2. **Network Layer**:
   - VPC with public and private subnets
   - Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway for network connectivity
   - Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - EC2 instances (t2.micro) for hosting containers
   - Auto Scaling Group to manage instance lifecycle
   - ECS Cluster to organize resources

4. **Storage & Registry**:
   - ECR Repository for storing Docker images
   - CloudWatch Logs for log management

5. **Security Layer**:
   - IAM Roles and Policies for access control
   - Security Groups for network security
   - Load Balancer for SSL termination

## Demo Application Overview

Our demo application is a simple Node.js Express API with the following features:

- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- System information endpoints for debugging
- Metadata endpoints to demonstrate container information
- Docker containerization with multi-stage build
- Load balancing across multiple containers
- Auto-scaling based on demand

## Deployment Process

The deployment process consists of the following steps:

1. **Build and Package**:
   - Containerize the application using Docker
   - Push the Docker image to Amazon ECR

2. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - Use Terraform to provision the required AWS resources
   - Create VPC, subnets, security groups, load balancer, etc.

3. **Application Deployment**:
   - Create ECS task definitions and services
   - Configure load balancing and health checks

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Set up CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
   - Configure auto-scaling for handling load changes
